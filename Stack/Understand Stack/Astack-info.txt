Mostly Array question are done with Stack
And if the sorting thingmis to be done then it is used by doing the heap

we some thime have dependent loop O(n^2) 
for(int i=0;i<n:i++){
    for(int j=0;k<i;j++)
    In such case u can write better solution with Stack

    Focus on the Concept
    1st understand which pattern
    then identify which variation


//Initiation of the stack syantax
stack<datatype> stackname;


//Some inportant method in the stack
stackname.push(value);
stackname.pop()
stackname.top()
mystack.size()
stackname.empty()   //return boolen
stack1.swap(stack2); //swap 1 with 2

//Mostly while loop used
while (!st1.empty()) {
		cout << st1.top() << " ";
		st1.pop();
	}
