//Heap and its identification

It is most of time dealing for the sorting purpose

it can be mostly identified with the help of the 2 things
1) Kvalue
2) largest/or/ smallest

For largest we have to make min heap 
      For the smallest we have to make use of the max heap

//--------------MIN heap declaration-----------//
priority_queue<int,vector<int>,greater<int>> minh;


//--------------MAX heap declaration-----------//
priority_queue<int> maxh;

Heap is use to reduce the sorting time to Nlog(N) to Nlog(k)
